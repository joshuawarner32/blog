# Moving Beyond Text

## Main points

* Software has been written in "plain text" for many _many_ years, and many _many_ tools have been built around it
* There's a lot of value and functionality in that tooling, so any change would need to overcome a large "activation energy"
* However, let's explore the positives:
    * No syntax errors, avoid simple semantic errors, recup lost productivity
    * Simpler automated tooling
        *  -> _more_ / _better_ automated tooling (at least, that's the hope!)
* Lots of history in this space, no one has hit the "home run" yet
* Does this _really_ enable any tooling that we don't already have, with parsers / Language Server Protocol / etc?
